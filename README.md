# Webpage-Content-Downloader
Downloads the content of a paginated html page given by the URL, page count and tag to be parsed from each page.

How to use:
1. Copy and paste the URL in the respected field.
2. Give the "Position from end". Meaning the position of the page index from end of the url.
	i.e if the URL is www.abcdef.com/list?count=99&user=abcde; then,
	index from last will be 13. [here page count field is count=12]
3. Now add "Page Count" field. i.e. how many page you want to get. It will always start from the first page. You'll only choose the last page count.
4. Add the "Tag" you want to copy. i.e "tr" if you want to copy table rows.
5. Click "Process" to start processing, "Cancel" to cancel the process and "Copy" to copy the data after processing is done.
